# ElementWars
A Pokemon-like RPG programmed in C++

This is a project made during my studies at Télécom Sudparis engineering school.

The purpose of the project was to create something fun in C/C++.

Me and my team chose to write a small game in C++, using SFML as a graphic renderer.

The report and slides for the project are in the folder "projet info", but is in French.

The project is made of two parts : the game itself, where we can play and control the caracter, and the map editor, where we can edit and create maps for the caracter to move in.

To run the project, simply run the run.bat file in the folder ProjetC, or use the IDE Code::Blocks to compile and run the project.
